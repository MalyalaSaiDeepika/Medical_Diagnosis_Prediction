# 🧠 Medical Diagnosis Prediction

This project predicts diseases from medical images like X-rays using deep learning.

## 📌 Overview

- Built using Google Colab (Python)
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Detects diseases from X-ray or similar medical images
- Can be extended for multi-label classification (multiple diseases)

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🗂️ File Info

- `Medical Diagnosis Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook for training, evaluation, and prediction

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab
2. Upload your medical image dataset (like Chest X-rays)
3. Train the model using provided code
4. Evaluate predictions and accuracy
